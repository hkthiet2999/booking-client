// The JWT Interceptor intercepts http requests from the application to add a JWT auth token to the Authorization header if the user is logged in and the request is to the application api url (environment.apiUrl).

// It's implemented using the HttpInterceptor class included in the HttpClientModule, by extending the HttpInterceptor class you can create a custom interceptor to modify http requests before they get sent to the server.

// Http interceptors are added to the request pipeline in the providers section of the app.module.ts file.
